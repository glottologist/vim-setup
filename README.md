#### Error

```
--  While building package text-icu-0.7.0.1 using: <my obnoxious path info>
    Process exited with code: ExitFailure 1

    Cabal-simple_mPHDZzAJ_1.24.2.0_ghc-8.0.2: Missing dependencies on foreign
    libraries:
    * Missing C libraries: icuuc, icui18n, icudata
    This problem can usually be solved by installing the system packages that
    provide these libraries (you may need the "-dev" versions). If the libraries
    are already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the
    flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where they are.
```

#### Fix

```
sudo apt install icu-devtools libicu-dev
```

#### Fix

```
sudo apt install ghc
stack install cabal-install
```

Also, don't forget to add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` if the script doesn't do it automatically.
